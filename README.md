# ☃️ Snowman Meltdown

A simple terminal-based word guessing game written in Python.  
Each wrong guess causes the snowman to melt a little... can you save him before he turns into a puddle?

---

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Run the game in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python snowman.py
2. Guess one letter at a time.
3. Each wrong guess melts part of the snowman.
4. If you guess the full word before he melts, you win.
   If not… 🫠 puddle time.
