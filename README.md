# ☃️ Snowman Meltdown

A simple **terminal-based word guessing game** written in Python.  
Each wrong guess causes the snowman to melt a little...  
Can you save him before he turns into a puddle? 🫠

---

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the game in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python snowman.py
   ```

2. Guess **one letter at a time**.  
3. Each wrong guess melts part of the snowman.  
4. If you guess the full word before he melts, you win.  
   If not… puddle time.
